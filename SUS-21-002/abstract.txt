Results showing the search for direct production of charginos and neutralinos via electroweak interactions. The results are based on data from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13\TeV collected with the CMS detector at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 137/fb. The search considers final states with large missing transverse momentum and pairs of hadronically decaying bosons \WW, \WZ, and \WH, where \PH is the Higgs boson. These bosons are identified using novel algorithms.
No significant excess of events is observed relative to the expectations from the standard model. Limits at the 95\% confidence level are placed on the cross section for production of mass-degenerate wino-like supersymmetric particles \firstcharg and \secondchi, and mass-degenerate higgsino-like supersymmetric particles \firstcharg, \secondchi, and \thirdchi. In the limit of a nearly-massless lightest supersymmetric particle \firstchi, wino-like particles with masses up to 870 and 960\GeV are excluded in the cases of $\secondchi\to\PZ\firstchi$ and $\secondchi\to\PH\firstchi$, respectively, and higgsino-like particles are excluded between 300 and 650\GeV.
