comment: Results showing the search for direct production of charginos and neutralinos
  via electroweak interactions.The results are based on data from proton-proton collisions
  at a center-of-mass energy of $13~\mathrm{TeV}$ collected with the CMS detector
  at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $137~\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$.The
  search considers final states with large missing transverse momentum and pairs of
  hadronically decaying bosons WW, WZ, and WH, where H is the Higgs boson.These bosons
  are identified using novel algorithms.No significant excess of events is observed
  relative to the expectations from the standard model.Limits at the 95\% confidence
  level are placed on the cross section for production of mass-degenerate wino-like
  supersymmetric particles $\widetilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}$ and $\widetilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}$,
  and mass-degenerate higgsino-like supersymmetric particles $\widetilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}$,
  $\widetilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}$, and $\widetilde{\chi}_{3}^{0}$.In the limit of a nearly-massless
  lightest supersymmetric particle $\widetilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}$, wino-like particles
  with masses up to 870 and $960~\mathrm{GeV}$ are excluded in the cases of $\widetilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\to\mathrm{Z}\widetilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}$
  and $\widetilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\to\mathrm{H}\widetilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}$, respectively,
  and higgsino-like particles are excluded between 300 and $650~\mathrm{GeV}$.
